<!-- So, I have tried to put python/jira in here to access the correct variables in numerous ways, and 
I have tried putting the code in app.py to call variables, but to no avail -->

<!-- From what I understand from the repository code, when calling the get_movie_by_title, it returns
a movie object.  Basically, I can't figure out how to store that call in app.py. I may need to call or 
reference the repository db directly for the specific searched movie's title and rating, but I have
absolutely no clue how to go about that -->

<!-- I'm probably making this way more difficult than it needs to be, but it has been a WHILE since I used 
repository-style methods, and I am hella rusty lol  -->
